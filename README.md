# Personal Website

Welcome to the Personal Website repository! This project is a personal website showcasing my programming portfolio, information about me, work experience, services, and extracurricular activities. I built my website using React, TypeScript, and Vite. The setup includes hot module replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to help maintain code quality.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Allows modules to be replaced without a full browser refresh.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
